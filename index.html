                <h3>Episode Synopsis (SPOILERS):</h3>
                <p>The party finds themselves in a long forgotten place, a hidden city in the desert!</p>
                <br />
                <p>Upon entering the dungeon inside of a large pyramid, a ghostly image of a kentri, half man half scorpion, appears. Identifying himself as Ertu, he tells them that they
                    must complete the challenge in order to leave alive. After going through the first trials of the dungeon, they encounter a group of kentri warriors 
                    in the center of the pyramid that attack them! 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>Nap notices a strange artifact during the battle and approaches it to pick it up. Upon grabbing it, he falls uncoscious. Fighting to the point of
                    exhuastion, they eventually overcome Ertu and his minions, completing the trial. The ghostly image of Ertu appears and tells the party of two other
                    lost cities in the desert. And that if they complete the trials there, the cities will reawaken and bring life back to the desert.
